This Erlang Program converts a DXF (binary or ASCII) to an HTML file. View it in an HTML5-ready browser (Safari, Chromium etc).

The DXF file can be created in QCAD, AUTOCAD and other CAD systems. Note that a closed pline will be filled in the HTML file. Entities with higher elevation will be on top in the HTML file.

1. Mirror your drawing in the CAD-app down over the X-axis (X=0)
2. Move the drawing up to it's previous position (up above the X-axis)
3. Save as DXF
4. Undo Move and Miror

In a terminal, type ./dxf2js.sh myfile 0

to create a file myfile.html with a canvas representation of the drawing.

If you are on a Windows system you have to create a bat-file or run dxf2js module from the erlang console.
 

The parameters to dxf2js.sh is a dxffilename without extension, and a layername

If the layer name is svg the output format will be svg, all other layers will be in canvas format. This makes it easy to create a combined svg/canvas graphics.
 
 You need to download Erlang http://www.erlang.org to run this program.
