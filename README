This Erlang Program converts a DXF (binary or ASCII) to an HTML file. View it in an HTML5-ready browser (Safari, Chromium etc).

The DXF file can be created in QCAD, AUTOCAD and other CAD systems. Note that a closed pline will be filled in the HTML file. Entities with higher elevation will be on top in the HTML file.

The parameters to dxf2js.sh is a dxffilename without extension, and a layername

If the layer name is svg the output format will be svg, all other layers will be in canvas format. This makes it easy to create a combined svg/canvas graphics.

The dxffile should be stored in a dir ../DXF

The HTML file is created in ../DXF 

 If you want the files elswhere - change the dxf2js.sh
 
 You need to download Erlang http://www.erlang.org to run this program.
